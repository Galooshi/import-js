# Vim support

import-js is meant to be used as a Pathogen plugin. Just `git clone` this repo
into the `bundles` folder and you are good to go!

## Dependencies

import-js is written in Ruby, so in order to make it work in your Vim you need
Ruby support. You can test for Ruby support by typing `:ruby 1` from within
Vim. If you don't have Ruby support, you'll see something like this:

```
 E319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version
```

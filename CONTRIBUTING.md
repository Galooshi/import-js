## Adding support for another editor

Most editor plugins will integrate with ImportJS via the command line utility.
Execute the `importjs` command in the project's root directory with the options
needed for the command you want to add, and parse the resulting JSON.

If your editor can consume plugins written in JavaScript (e.g. Atom), then you
can depend on the import-js package directly, which exports the base `Importer`
class.

## Testing

ImportJS uses Jest to test its behavior. To run tests, first ensure that this
project's dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Once you have the dependencies installed, you just type `npm test` in the root
folder of the project to run all tests.

```sh
тиа npm test

> import-js@0.7.0 test /path/to/import-js
> npm run --silent lint; npm run --silent jest

Using Jest CLI v11.0.2, jasmine2, babel-jest

 PASS  lib/__tests__/Importer-test.js (27.172s)
285 tests passed (285 total in 7 test suites, run time 29.123s)
```

## Trying local changes

You can try your changes out by running `npm link` in the importjs repo
directory. This will symlink the globally installed version of the package to
your local version.

To keep the linked version up to date with your changes as you make them, you
can run `npm run build`. If you'd like to have this automatically happen as you
make changes, you can run the build process in watch mode: `npm run build --
--watch`.

When you are done trying your local changes, you can go back to the version you
had installed by running `npm unlink` in the importjs repo directory.

## Testing the daemon

This is how you can test the `importjs` daemon from the command line.

```sh
mkfifo IMPORTJS
importjs < IMPORTJS
```

The `importjs` process will now listen to `stdin` from the named pipe
(`"IMPORTJS"`). You can print to it using echo:

```sh
echo '{"fileContent": "...", "pathToFile": "foo.js", "command": "fix"}' > IMPORTJS
```

## Publishing

First ensure that your master is up to date:

```sh
git checkout master
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master
```

Now you are ready to tag a new version, publish, and push:

```sh
npm version (major|minor|patch)
npm publish
git push --tags origin master
```

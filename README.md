ImportJS is a tool to automatically import dependencies in your JavaScript
project. Use it along with one of our editor integrations for
[Atom][atom-import-js], [Emacs][emacs-import-js], [Sublime][sublime-import-js],
[Vim][vim-import-js], or [VS Code][vs-code-import-js].

## Dependency on Babel 7

ImportJS uses [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/v7-migration.html) from version [3.1.0](https://github.com/Galooshi/import-js/releases/tag/v3.1.0). In most cases, Babel 7 is backwards-compatible with Babel 6, but if you run into issues (such as [this one about decorators](https://github.com/Galooshi/import-js/issues/515)), consider installing a previous version of ImportJS (e.g. [3.0.0](https://github.com/Galooshi/import-js/releases/tag/v3.0.0)) or updating your project to be Babel 7 compatible.

## Importing: Example

Let's say that you have a JavaScript project with the following structure:

```
.
|-- index.html
|-- components
|     |-- button.js
|     |-- icon.js
|-- vendor
|     |--
|-- pages
|     |-- index.js
```

Now, imagine that you're editing `pages/index.js` which contains:

```javascript
document.createElement(new Button({ text: 'Save' }).toDOMElement());
```

At this point, `Button` is undefined, so we need to import it. If you are used
to doing this manually, this involves figuring out the path to the JavaScript
module that defines `Button`. With ImportJS you instead place your cursor on
the word "Button", then hit `<leader>j` (Vim), `(M-x) import-js-import` (Emacs),
or choose "ImportJS: import word under cursor" (Sublime). The file buffer will
now change to the following:

```javascript
import Button from '../components/button';

document.createElement(new Button({ text: 'Save' }).toDOMElement());
```

That's basically it. ImportJS will help you find modules and automatically add
`import` statements. But, keep reading for more neat features.

## Fix imports

ImportJS can be used to automatically fix all imports in the current file. By
hitting `<leader>i` (Vim), `(M-x) import-js-fix` (Emacs), or choose `ImportJS:
fix all imports` (Sublime), all your undefined variables will be resolved, and
all your unused imports will be removed.

If you're using JSX, ImportJS will no longer automatically import `React` for you. If this is something you need, please consider using ImportJS version 5.1.0 or earlier. The need for React imports to use JSX was removed in React 17. Read more [here](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html)

## Go to module

Since ImportJS is pretty good at finding JS modules, it makes sense that
there's an option to open/go to a file rather than import it. This is similar
to Vim's built in ["Open file under cursor"][vim open file]. Use it by placing
the cursor on a variable and hit `<leader>g` (Vim), `(M-x) import-js-goto`
(Emacs), or choose "ImportJS: goto module" (Sublime).

[vim open file]: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Open_file_under_cursor

## Things to note

- Only files ending in `.js\*` and `.ts*` are considered when importing
- As part of resolving imports, all imports will be sorted and placed into
  groups. _Grouping and sorting can be disabled, see the `groupImports` and `sortImports` configuration
  options. Comments and whitespace will be preserved if these are both disabled._
- You can speed up ImportJS by installing
  [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/). See [Speeding it
  up!](#speeding-it-up) for more information.

## Configuration

ImportJS is configured through a JavaScript file (`.importjs.js`).

The file needs to export a single object containing you configuration settings, like the
example below.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  excludes: ['./react-components/**/test/**'],
  // continue with the rest of your settings...
};
```

Save this file in the root folder of your project (e.g. where the package.json
file is found). You can also save it to the user home directory if you want to
share a global config between different projects.

The following configuration options are supported.

- [`aliases`](#aliases)
- [`declarationKeyword`](#declarationkeyword)
- [`environments`](#environments)
- [`excludes`](#excludes)
- [`globals`](#globals)
- [`groupImports`](#groupimports)
- [`ignorePackagePrefixes`](#ignorepackageprefixes)
- [`importDevDependencies`](#importdevdependencies)
- [`importFunction`](#importfunction)
- [`importStatementFormatter`](#importstatementformatter)
- [`logLevel`](#loglevel)
- [`maxLineLength`](#maxlinelength)
- [`minimumVersion`](#minimumversion)
- [`moduleNameFormatter`](#modulenameformatter)
- [`namedExports`](#namedexports)
- [`sortImports`](#sortimports)
- [`stripFileExtensions`](#stripfileextensions)
- [`danglingCommas`](#danglingcommas)
- [`tab`](#tab)
- [`useRelativePaths`](#userelativepaths)
- [`mergableOptions`](#mergableoptions)

### `excludes`

Define a list of glob patterns that match files and directories that you don't
want to include for importing.

```javascript
excludes: ['./react-components/**/test/**'];
```

### `aliases`

Some variable names might not easily map to a file in the filesystem. For those,
you can add them to the `aliases` configuration.

```javascript
aliases: {
  $: 'third-party-libs/jquery',
  _: 'third-party-libs/underscore',
}
```

Aliases can be made dynamic by using the `{filename}` string. This part of the
alias will be replaced by the name of the file you are currently editing.

e.g.

```javascript
aliases: {
  styles: './{filename}.scss',
}
```

will for a file `foo/bar.js` result in

```javascript
import styles from './bar.scss';
```

### `environments`

This list of environments controls what core modules are available when
importing, and what variables are considered global by default. The supported
values right now are

- `['meteor']` - make the core modules for [Meteor][Meteor]
  available, and add a bunch of [meteor
  globals](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globals/blob/38d9a0c/globals.json#L1116)
- `['node']` - make [all the core modules for Node][node core modules]
  available, and add a bunch of [node
  globals](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globals/blob/38d9a0c/globals.json#L848)
- `['browser']` - add a bunch of [browser
  globals](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globals/blob/38d9a0c/globals.json#L162)
- `['jasmine']` - add a bunch of [jasmine
  globals](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globals/blob/38d9a0c/globals.json#L901)
- `['jest']` - add a bunch of [jest
  globals](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globals/blob/38d9a0c/globals.json#L921)
- - a few more, as defined by https://github.com/sindresorhus/globals

[Meteor]: https://meteor.com
[Node core modules]: https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_core_modules

```javascript
environments: ['meteor', 'node'];
```

### `namedExports`

\*Note: Since 2.1.0 ImportJS finds your named exports automatically. Most
likely you don't need this option. If you end up having to use this
configuration anyway, there might be a bug in the exports-finding parts of
ImportJS. [File an issue](https://github.com/Galooshi/import-js/issues) and
tell us about it!

If you have an ES6/ES2015 module that exports multiple things (named exports),
or a CommonJS module that exports an object with properties on it that you want
to destructure when importing, you can add those to a `namedExports`
configuration option.

```javascript
namedExports: {
  underscore: [
    'omit',
    'debounce',
    'memoize'
  ],
  'lib/utils': [
    'escape',
    'hasKey',
  ],
}
```

Imports that use the `import` declaration keyword then use [named imports
syntax][]. e.g.

```javascript
import { memoize } from 'underscore';

memoize(() => {
  foo();
});
```

and imports that use `const` or `var` use [ES2015 Destructuring
Assigment][destructing assignment], e.g.

```javascript
const { memoize } = require('underscore');

memoize(() => {
  foo();
});
```

[named imports syntax]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import
[destructuring assignment]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment

The key used to describe the named exports should be a valid import path. This
can be e.g. the name of a package found under `node_modules`, a path to a
module you created yourself, or a relative import path.

Consider the example as a valid use case for the `namedExports` property. Let's say we have a file:

```jsx
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import React from 'react';
import store from './redux/redux-store';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

And we're going to import `BrowserRouter` but instead of the desired result we get
the _No JS module to import for `BrowserRouter`_ message.
In order to fix the problem, populate `namedExports` in your config file as follows:

```js
namedExports: {
  'react-router-dom': ['BrowserRouter', 'Route', 'Redirect']
}
```

After that we are able to import `BrowserRouter` correctly. The resulting import statement will look like this:

`import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'`

### `declarationKeyword`

The default value for this property is `import`, making your import statements
use the [ES2015 modules syntax][]:

[ES2015 modules syntax]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import

```javascript
import Foo from 'foo';
```

If you aren't ready for ES2015 yet, you have the option to use `var` or `const`
instead.

```javascript
declarationKeyword: 'const';
```

In such case, your import statements will look something like this:

```javascript
var Foo = require('foo'); // "declarationKeyword": "var"
const Foo = require('foo'); // "declarationKeyword": "const"
```

### `globals`

Provide a list of global identifiers used in the code. ImportJS will ignore
these when trying to import all undefined variables.

_Note: If you use the [`environments`](#environments) configuration option
correctly, you might not need to specify globals_.

### `groupImports`

By default, ImportJS will put imports into groups:

1. Core modules
2. Package dependencies
3. One or more groups with internal imports

You can turn off this behavior by setting `groupImports` to `false`. When
disabled, imports are listed alphabetically in one list.

```javascript
groupImports: false;
```

### `sortImports`

By default, ImportJS will sort imports by the name or path of the imported module.

You can turn off this behavior by setting `sortImports` to `false`. When
disabled, existing imports are not rearranged, and new imports are always added above existing imports.

```javascript
sortImports: false;
```

### `emptyLineBetweenGroups`

By default, ImportJS will insert empty line between import groups.

You can turn off this behavior by setting `emptyLineBetweenGroups` to `false`.

```javascript
emptyLineBetweenGroups: false;
```

### `importDevDependencies`

ImportJS will look for package dependencies listed in `package.json` when
importing. By default, only modules listed under `dependencies` and
`peerDependencies` will be used. By setting `importDevDependencies` to
`true`, `devDependencies` will also be taken into account.

```javascript
importDevDependencies: true;
```

### `danglingCommas`

By default, ImportJS will add trailing commas when constructing import statements with multiple named imports.

You can turn off this behavior by setting `danglingCommas` to `false`.

```javascript
danglingCommas: false;
```

### `importFunction`

_Note: this only applies if you are using `var` or `const` as
`declarationKeyword`._

The default value for this configuration option is `"require"`, which is [the
standard CommonJS function name used for
importing](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1).

```javascript
importFunction: 'myCustomRequireFunction';
```

### `stripFileExtensions`

An array that controls what file extensions are stripped out from the resulting
import statement. The default configuration strips out `[".js", ".jsx", ".ts",
".tsx"]`. Set to an empty array `[]` to avoid stripping out extensions.

```javascript
stripFileExtensions: ['.web.js', '.js'];
```

### `useRelativePaths`

This option is enabled by default. When enabled, imports will be resolved
relative to the current file being edited.

```javascript
import Foo from './foo';
import Bar from '../baz/bar';
```

You can disable this by setting it to false:

```javascript
useRelativePaths: false;
```

Package dependencies (located in `node_modules`) will not be imported
relatively.

### `ignorePackagePrefixes`

If you have package dependencies specified in `package.json` that are prefixed
with e.g. an organization name but want to be able to import these without the
package prefix, you can set the `ignorePackagePrefixes` configuration option.

```javascript
ignorePackagePrefixes: ['my-company-'];
```

When package dependencies are matched, these prefixes will be ignored. As an
example, a variable named `validator` would match a package named
`my-company-validator`.

### `minimumVersion`

Setting `minimumVersion` will warn people who are running a version of
ImportJS that is older than what your `.importjs.js` configuration file
requires. If your plugin version is older than this value, you will be shown a
warning that encourages you to upgrade your plugin.

```javascript
minimumVersion: '1.0.0';
```

### `maxLineLength`

Defaults to `80`. This setting controls when import statements are broken into
multiple lines.

```javascript
maxLineLength: 70;
```

### `moduleNameFormatter`

Use a function here to control how the resulting module name string will look
like. It's useful if you for instance want to add a custom prefix to certain
imports. Apart from the standard `pathToCurrentFile` and `pathToImportedModule`
values passed in to all configuration functions, this method is also passed a
`moduleName` value, which in general is what you want to manipulate.

```javascript
moduleNameFormatter({ moduleName, pathToCurrentFile }) {
 if (/-test/.test(pathToCurrentFile)) {
   // Import a mocked version in test files
   return `mocks/${moduleName}`;
 }

 if (moduleName.startsWith('foo')) {
   // Add a leading slash to foo imports
   return `/${moduleName}`;
 }

 // Fall back to the original specifier. It's important that this function
 // always returns a string.
 return moduleName;
},
```

### `importStatementFormatter`

Use a function here to control how the resulting import statement will look
like. This is useful if you for instance want to strip out trailing semicolons
(that ImportJS adds by default).

Note: this method should only be used in rare cases. There's a chance that
ImportJS won't be able to recognize the resulting import statement next time it
is about to import something.

```javascript
importStatementFormatter({ importStatement }) {
  return importStatement.replace(/;$/, '');
},
```

### `tab`

Defaults to two spaces (`"  "`). This setting controls how indentation is
constructed when import statements are broken into multiple lines.

```javascript
tab: '\t';
```

### `logLevel`

One of `["debug", "info", "warn", "error"]`. This controls what ends up in the
logfile. The default is `info`.

```javascript
logLevel: 'debug';
```

The logfile is written to "importjs.log" in your operating system's default
directory for temporary files. You can get the path to the log file by running
`importjs logpath`.

### `mergableOptions`

A dictionary of Options that be merged with defaults and values provided by an [`environment`](#environments). This can be used to overwrite options provided by environments. Defaults to:

```javascript
mergableOptions: {
  aliases: true,
  coreModules: true,
  namedExports: true,
  globals: true,
}
```

Note: the `mergableOptions` option will always be merged and will be ignored if
included in a user config.

To disable merging a particular option or set of options, set the key to
`false`:

```javascript
mergableOptions: {
  globals: false;
}
```

For example, if you are using the `meteor` environment but want to explicitly
import modules which are provided as globals, you can use this setting to
overwrite the environment globals.

```javascript
const globals = require('globals');
module.exports = {
  environments: ['meteor', 'node'],
  mergableOptions: {
    globals: false, // Overwrite globals
  },
  globals: [
    // Add the globals you want back in
    ...Object.keys(globals.builtin), // include javascript builtins
    ...Object.keys(globals.node), // include node globals
    'Package',
    'Npm', // Include meteor globals for `package.js` files
  ],
};
```

### `parserPlugins`

ImportJS defaults to a reasonable compromise for what syntax to support but can be overridden (replaced) in configuration. The latest defaults can be found [here](lib/parse.js#L3)

Available plugins are over at [Babel: Plugins List](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins-list)

#### Example: Remove all preconfigured defaults

```javascript
parserPlugins: []
```

#### Example: Add pipeline operator (`hack` proposal)

When `parserPlugins` is specified you need to re-add the defaults.

```javascript
parserPlugins: [
  'jsx',
  'doExpressions',
  'objectRestSpread',
  'decorators-legacy',
  'classProperties',
  'classPrivateProperties',
  'classPrivateMethods',
  'exportExtensions',
  'asyncGenerators',
  'functionBind',
  'functionSent',
  'dynamicImport',
  'numericSeparator',
  'optionalChaining',
  'importMeta',
  'bigInt',
  'optionalCatchBinding',
  'throwExpressions',
  'nullishCoalescingOperator',
  'exportNamespaceFrom',
  'exportDefaultFrom',
  [
    'pipelineOperator',
    {
      proposal: 'hack',
    },
  ],
]
```

## Dynamic configuration

Different sections of your application may have special importing needs. For
instance, your tests might need the `'const'` declaration keyword, but the rest
of your application can use `'import'`. To be able to target these special
cases, you can turn your configuration option into a function. When ImportJS
resolves a configuration option, it will check to see if a function is used. In
such case, the function is invoked with the following arguments:

- `pathToCurrentFile`: (always available) A path to the file you are editing.
- `pathToImportedModule` (not available for some options) A path to the
  file/module you are importing.

Here's an example of how to dynamically control the `declarationKeyword`
configuration option based on the file you are importing:

```javascript
// .importjs.js
function isTestFile(path) {
  return path.endsWith('-test.js');
}

module.exports = {
  declarationKeyword({ pathToImportedModule }) {
    if (isTestFile(pathToImportedModule)) {
      return 'const';
    }
    return 'import';
  },
};
```

Here's a more elaborate example taking both `pathToImportedModule` and
`pathToCurrentFile` into account:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  useRelativePaths({ pathToImportedModule, pathToCurrentFile }) {
    if (pathToCurrentFile.endsWith('-mock.js')) {
      return false;
    }
    if (pathToImportedModule.endsWith('-test.js')) {
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  },
};
```

In order to use functions, you need to use the JavaScript configuration file
(`.importjs.js`).

## Command-line tool

ImportJS comes with a handy command-line tool that can help you perform
importing outside of an editor. Under the hood, this is what most of the editor
integrations use.

```bash
⨠ importjs --help

  Usage: importjs [options] [command]


  Commands:

    word [options] <word> <pathToFile>
    search [options] <word> <pathToFile>
    fix [options] <pathToFile>
    rewrite [options] <pathToFile>
    add [options] <imports> <pathToFile>
    goto <word> <pathToFile>
    start [options]                       start a daemon
    cachepath                             show path to cache file
    logpath                               show path to log file

  Options:

    -h, --help     output usage information
    -V, --version  output the version number

  Examples:

    $ importjs word someModule path/to/file.js
    $ importjs search someModule* path/to/file.js
    $ importjs fix path/to/file.js
    $ importjs rewrite --overwrite path/to/file.js
    $ importjs add '{ "foo": "path/to/foo", "bar": "path/to/bar" }' path/to/file.js
    $ importjs goto someModule path/to/file.js
    $ importjs cachepath
    $ importjs logpath
    $ importjs start --parent-pid=12345
```

### Batch-rewriting

If you want to change how imports are constructed in an existing project, you
can use the command-line tool in combination with `find` to batch-update a set
of files. E.g.

```bash
find ./app -name "**.js*" -exec importjs rewrite --overwrite {} \;
```

Since the `--overwrite` flag makes ImportJS destructive (files are overwritten),
it's a good thing to double-check that the `find` command returns the right
files before adding the `-exec` part.

## Specifying alternate package directory

ImportJS looks for the `package.json` file in the closest ancestor directory for the file you're editing to find node modules to import. However, sometimes it might pull dependencies from a directory further up the chain. For example, your directory structure might look like this:

```
.
|-- package.json
|-- components
|     |-- button.js
|     |-- icon.js
|-- node_modules
|     |-- react
|-- subpackage
|     |-- package.json
|     |-- components
|           |-- bulletin.js
```

If you were to use ImportJS on `subpackage/components/bulletin.js` which imports React, ImportJS would not know that `react` is a valid dependency.

To tell ImportJS to skip a directory and keep searching upwards to find the root package directory, specify `"importjs": { "isRoot": false }` in the `package.json` of the directory to ignore. In this case, you would want something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "subpackage",
  ...
  "importjs": {
    "isRoot": false
  }
}
```

## Running as a daemon

_Note_: This section is intended mostly for developers of editor plugins. If
you are using one of the standard editor plugins, you are most likely using the
daemon under the hood already.

You can run ImportJS in a background process and communicate with it using
`stdin` and `stdout`. This will make importing faster because we're not
spinning up a node environment on every invocation.

The daemon is started by running running `importjs`. It accepts commands sent
via `stdin`. Each command is a (oneline) JSON string ending with a newline. The
command structure is basically the same as for the command-line tool, but
wrapped in JSON instead of expressed on the command line. Here are a few
examples:

Run `fix imports`:

```json
{
  "command": "fix",
  "fileContent": "const foo = bar();\n",
  "pathToFile": "foo.js"
}
```

Import a single word:

```json
{
  "command": "word",
  "commandArg": "bar",
  "fileContent": "const foo = bar();\n",
  "pathToFile": "foo.js"
}
```

Goto:

```json
{
  "command": "goto",
  "commandArg": "bar",
  "fileContent": "const foo = bar();\n",
  "pathToFile": "foo.js"
}
```

Results are printed to `stdout` in JSON format. The response will look the same
as what the command-line tool produces. If an error occurs, it will also end up
in `stdout` as JSON (an object with an `error` key).

On startup, the daemon will print a path to a logfile. If you want to find out
what's going on behind the scenes, you can inspect this file. If you don't have
access to the console log of the daemon, you'll find the logfile in
`os.tmpdir() + '/importjs.log` (which will resolve to something like
`var/folders/1l/_t6tm7195nd53936tsvh2pcr0000gn/T/importjs.log` on a Mac).

## Speeding it up!

If you have a large application, traversing the file system to find modules can
be slow. That's why ImportJS has built-in integration with
[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/), a fast and robust file
watching service developed by Facebook. All you have to do to get a performance
boost is to [install watchman
locally](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html), and make sure
to use an up-to-date editor plugin (Watchman is only used when ImportJS is run
as a daemon).
